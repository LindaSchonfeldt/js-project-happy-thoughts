## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Styled Components** for dynamic CSS-in-JS styling
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Context API** for global state management
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Integration

- **RESTful API** with Express.js and MongoDB
- **JWT Authentication** with secure token management
- **User Ownership** validation for CRUD operations
- **Population Queries** for efficient user data retrieval

## Core Components & Architecture

### 1. Authentication System

```jsx
// AuthContext.jsx - Global auth state management
const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth()

// Features:
// - JWT token validation and refresh
// - User session persistence
// - Real-time auth state updates
// - Secure logout with cleanup
```

### 2. Thought Management

```jsx
// useThoughts.js - Complete CRUD operations
const {
  thoughts,
  createThought,
  updateThought,
  deleteThought,
  refreshThoughtsOnAuthChange,
  resetToFirstPageOnLogin
} = useThoughts()

// Features:
// - Optimistic UI updates
// - Server synchronization
// - Auth-based refresh triggers
// - Pagination and filtering
```

### 3. Like System

```jsx
// useLikeSystem.js - Individual thought interactions
const { isLiked, likeCount, handleLike } = useLikeSystem(
  thoughtId,
  initialHearts
)

// Features:
// - localStorage persistence
// - Optimistic heart updates
// - Cross-session like tracking
// - Anonymous and authenticated support
```

### 4. Authorization Logic

```jsx
// Real-time permission checking
const canEdit = useMemo(() => {
  return isAuthenticated && userId === currentUserId && username !== 'Anonymous'
}, [userId, currentUserId, isAuthenticated, username])

// Features:
// - Instant button show/hide on login/logout
// - Ownership validation
// - Anonymous thought protection
// - Secure frontend + backend validation
```

## Authentication & Authorization Flow

### Login Process

1. User submits credentials → API validation
2. Server returns JWT + user data
3. Frontend stores token + updates auth context
4. All components re-render with new permissions
5. Thought list refreshes to show edit/delete buttons
6. Real-time UI updates without delay

### Authorization Checks

- **Frontend**: Instant UI updates based on user ownership
- **Backend**: Server-side validation with user population
- **Database**: Proper user field relationships and queries

### Security Features

- JWT tokens with expiration handling
- User ownership validation on all modifications
- Anonymous thought protection (cannot be edited/deleted)
- CORS configuration for secure API access
- Input validation and sanitization

## API Integration

**Backend Repository**: [Happy Thoughts API](https://github.com/yourusername/happy-thoughts-api)

**Base URL**: https://happy-thoughts-api-yn3p.onrender.com

### Key Endpoints

#### Authentication

```javascript
POST / auth / register // User registration
POST / auth / login // User authentication with JWT
```

#### Thoughts Management

```javascript
GET /thoughts?page=1&limit=10        // Paginated thoughts with user population
GET /thoughts/:id                    // Single thought with user data
POST /thoughts                       // Create thought (auth required)
PUT /thoughts/:id                    // Update own thought (auth + ownership)
DELETE /thoughts/:id                 // Delete own thought (auth + ownership)
```

#### Social Features

```javascript
POST /thoughts/:id/like              // Like/unlike (supports anonymous)
GET /thoughts/trending               // Popular thoughts
GET /thoughts/tag/:tag               // Filter by specific tag
```

## State Management Strategy

### Global State (Context API)

```jsx
// AuthProvider - User authentication state
<AuthProvider>
  // ThoughtsProvider - Thought data and operations
  <ThoughtsProvider>
    <App />
  </ThoughtsProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

### Local Component State

- Form inputs and validation states
- UI states (loading, modals, dropdowns)
- Temporary data before API submission

### Persistent State (localStorage)

- JWT tokens for session management
- User like history for cross-session tracking
- User preferences and settings

### Real-time Updates

- Auth state changes trigger immediate UI updates
- Thought list refreshes on login/logout
- Optimistic updates with server reconciliation

## Development Workflow

### Setup

```bash
